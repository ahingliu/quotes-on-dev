## PERSONAL LEARNINGS:

This project helped me to cement my knowledge on WordPress hierarchy and advance in Ajax methods, REST API calls and JSON files. Also helped me consolidate a lot of the tools we have been using so far, especialy SCSS and Jquery.  

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate for your taste!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
